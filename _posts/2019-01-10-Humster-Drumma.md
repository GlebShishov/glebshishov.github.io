The game was created in less than 72 hours for the Ludum Dare #43 contest.
You play as a hamster possessed by an evil drummer. Henceforth, your raison d'Ãªtre is to lead your peers to safety by guiding them through the dangers of this unpleasant world with the power of SICK BEATS.
Why? For the glory of Satan, of course!
