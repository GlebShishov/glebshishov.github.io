Browser game created in 3 days for the competition Ludum Dare 44
Genre : Runner Rpg
gist: Fight demons using the skills of a vampire lord.
Sometimes the best way to avoid oneâ€™s grave is to put someone else in it! You play as a descendant of a mighty bloodline of Blood Harvesters. Power through the lines of enemies. Claim their power as your own! Choose the skills which suit you best. Consume the blood from fallen enemies and use it to cast powerful spells. Be wary, however, for your flesh can only contain a limited pool of blood.
