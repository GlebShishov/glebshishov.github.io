Browser game created in 3 days for the competition Ludum Dare 41
genre : tower defense
Bottom line : don't let the hordes of rebel mummies reach the end of the bash. Put up defensive towers and kill enemy armies.
The idea was to make the player move around the map as in platformer type game, but the rules of the game were similar to Tower Defense games. Later on we decided to put the game in an Egyptian setting primarily from a color scheme perspective. Whether we succeed or not it is up to you)
