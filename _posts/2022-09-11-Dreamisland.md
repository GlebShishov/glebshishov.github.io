"Dream Island" is the largest indoor theme park in Europe,
which includes a shopping and entertainment complex and a landscape park with a waterfront.
Brand packaging, logo design, identity design, development of mobile application and website.
The task of the project is to unify different brand products under one visual style.
The design is focused on conveying the mood of the holiday. Bright and saturated colors were used.
